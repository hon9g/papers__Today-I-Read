## How to Read Paper: Three Pass Approach
#### FIRST PASS
1. Carefully read the `title`, `abstract`, and `introduction`.
2. Read the `section and sub-section headings`, but ignore everything else.
3. Glance at the `mathematical contents` to determine the underlying theoretical foundations.
4. Read the `conclusions`.
5. Glance over the `reference`.
#### checkpoint for the first pass
1. **Category**: 
    - what type of paper is this?
    - A measurement paper?
    - An analysis of an existing system?
    - A description of a research prototype?
2. **Context**:
    - Which other papers is it related to?
    - Which theoretical bases were used to analyze the problem?
3. **Correctness**:
    - Do the assumptions appear to be valid?
4. **Contributions**:
    - What are the paper's main contributions?
5. **Clarity**:
    - Is the paper well written?

#### SECOND PASS
1. Look carefully at the `figure`, `diagrams` and other `illustrations` in the paper.
    - Pay specially attention to `graphs`.
    - Are the axes properly labeled?
    - Are results shown with error bars, so that conclusions are statistically significant?
2. Remember to mark relevant unread reference for further reading.
#### checkpoint for the second pass
- Grasp the content of the paper.
- Should be able to summarize the **main thrust** of the paper, with **supporting evidence**, to someone else.

---

#### checkpoint for the third pass
- **To attempt to virtually re-implement the paper.**
    - Making same assumptions as authors,
    - re-create the work.
    - Try to identify its **hidden failings and assumptions**, not only its innovations.
